## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge. I used it to improve my knowledge of responsive design, specifically with the Bootstrap framework. I spent a good amount of time delving deep into Bootstrap variables and components to build the project within its system as much as possible.

This project was also a great way to reinforce the importance of good project planning to create clean code in a more efficient way.

### Continued development

In the the next project I take on I hope to continue improving on what I have already learnt, with the addition of more JavaScript and likely working with an API.
